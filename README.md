This repo houses the final project our group worked on for our computational physics 
class at Georgia Tech. 

The "Scattering.ipynb" notebook contains the project overview and results. The 
code we wrote to simulate nuclear scattering is in the "scattering_class.py" file.
The experimental data we referenced has been transcribed manually in Scattering_Data.txt".
